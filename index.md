### Area of Interests
My research interests are nutrition though at the stage of M.A. and B.A. i primarily studied in food safety and quality of agricultural products and food safety. Currently, I mainly focus on how to evaluate the nutritional quality of agricultural products and according to different qualities of agricultural products （in my studying area，the agricultural products are plants oil，meat and nuts）to establish a model of evaluation, The function of this model is to evaluate the fatty acid quality of three products，as i mentioned before，and according to the final score to judge which agricultural product has more nutritional value. Like Amino Acid Score (AAS) which can get a final score to evaluate which types of food have more abundant amino acid and more suitable with human. This model I established can provides a effective suggestion ahout how to pick up those foods which have higher factty acid value. Simultaneously, the area of nutrition is attractive me as well. I really prefer to acquire more knowledge about this filed.

1. precision nutrition
2. fatty acids
3. nutritional evaluation
